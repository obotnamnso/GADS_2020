LAB 1: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

Overview: 
In this lab, we will create virtual machines (VMs) and connect to them. We will also create connections between the instances.

Objectives:
In this lab, We will learn how to perform the following tasks:
    -Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
    -Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
    -Connect between the two instances.
Tasks:
1. Create a virtual machine using the GCP Console.
    gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-1" --zone=us-central1-a --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project=debian-cloud --image=debian-9-stretch-v20200902 --subnet "default" --tags=http-server
    
    gcloud compute firewall-rules create default-allow-http --direction=INGRESS --action=ALLOW --rules=tcp:80 --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags=http

2. Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line:
    -Choose a zone from that list other than the zone to which Qwiklabs assigned. 	
    gcloud config set compoute/zone us-cental1-b 
    gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project=debian-cloud --image=debian-9-stretch-v20200902 --subnet "default" 

3. Connect between VM instances
   1. Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
	-Connect to my-vm-2:
		gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2
	-ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:
		ping -c 4 my-vm-1
	-Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-2:
		ssh my-vm-1
	-At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:
		sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
	-Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:
		sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
	-Moving the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:
		Hi from Namnso Obot
	-Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.
	-Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
		curl http://localhost/
	-Result: The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
	-To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
		exit
	-To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
		curl http://my-vm-1/
	-Result: The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
   2. Copy the External IP address for my-vm-1 from the command line:
		gcloud computes instances list --zone us-cenral1-a
   3. Paste it into the address bar of a new browser tab ad press enter.
	-Result: You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text.
